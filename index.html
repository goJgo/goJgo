        <p class="blog">In Minecraft, I finally started building my house. I thought of doing it for a really long time and I finally started it. I only got time to finish the walls but next time a play I will try to finish.</p>
        
       <p class="blog">I had way too much raw patatoes. I did have cooked potatoes but I wanted to eat the raw potatoes instead since I had so much. I ended up eating a stack.</p>
        
        <p class="blog">I used spruce wood planks and cobblestone for the walls. I'm still planning on what the roof should look like.</p>

        <p class="blog">Today is the day that marks a melenium from where my great, great, great * 999 grandfather wrote his first and last blog.</p>
        <p class="blog">It's hard to think how hard life was back then. There was so much people on earth. Now 50% of those people have moven to Mars. The book "The Martian" seemed surprising that people came to visit Mars.</p>
        <p class="blog">There's going to be a sandstorm coming. Better put a tent over the crops. See you!</p>
